# What is Cloud Computing? 

![cloud_picture](https://png.pngtree.com/png-vector/20220603/ourmid/pngtree-cloud-internet-storage-png-image_4795053.png)

Imagine you have a lot of files and programs on your computer, but sometimes your computer gets slow or runs out of space. Now, think of cloud computing as a giant, invisible computer system made up of many powerful computers connected over the internet.

Instead of storing all your files and running all your programs on your personal computer, you can use the cloud. It's like renting space and computing power on this giant system. So, when you save something to the cloud or use an online service like Google Drive or Netflix, you're actually using the storage space and computing power of these big, remote computers.

It's handy because you can access your stuff from anywhere with an internet connection, and you're not limited by the storage or processing power of y

## How do we know if something is in the cloud 

Determining whether something is in the cloud usually involves considering how it's accessed and where it's stored:

* *Access Method* If you access a service or data through a web browser or a mobile app, it's likely to be in the cloud. Examples include Gmail for email, Google Drive for file storage, and Netflix for streaming movies.
* **Data Location** Check where your files or data are stored. If they're stored on your local device or on servers within your company's premises, it's likely on-premises. If they're stored on servers operated by a third-party cloud provider, it's in the cloud.
* **Service Providers** ifyou're using services provided by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Dropbox, these are cloud services.
* **Scalability and Flexibility** Cloud services often offer scalability and flexibility that on-premises solutions may not. If a service can quickly adapt to changes in demand or if you can easily increase your storage capacity without physical upgrades, it's likely cloud-based.
* **Network Dependency** If accessing the service requires an internet connection, it's often cloud-based. On-premises systems may work offline or within a local network.

 ## What are the 4 deployment models of cloud?


![model](https://www.turningcloud.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cloud-deployment-models.jpg)

* **Private Cloud**

 Private clouds are dedicated infrastructures exclusively owned and operated by a single organization or a third-party provider.
 Access to resources and services is restricted to the organization or a select group of users.
 Users have full control over the infrastructure, allowing them to customize configurations, security policies, and resource allocation according to their specific needs.
 Private clouds are typically deployed within an organization's data center or hosted by a third-party provider on dedicated servers. They offer enhanced security, compliance, and customization options but require significant upfront investment and maintenance.

* **Public Cloud** 

 Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party service providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
 Resources and services are shared among multiple users and organizations over the internet.
 Users have limited control over the underlying infrastructure but can access a wide range of services, including compute, storage, networking, and databases, on a pay-as-you-go basis.
 Public cloud providers maintain and manage the infrastructure, allowing users to access and use resources on-demand via web-based interfaces or APIs. Public clouds offer scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, making them ideal for startups, small businesses, and enterprises with fluctuating workloads.

* **Hybrid Cloud**

 Hybrid clouds combine both private and public cloud infrastructures, allowing data and applications to be seamlessly shared between them.
 Users can dynamically move workloads between on-premises infrastructure and public cloud environments based on performance, security, and cost considerations.
 Organizations have greater flexibility and control over their data and applications, enabling them to leverage the scalability and agility of the public cloud while maintaining sensitive workloads on-premises.
 Hybrid clouds use a combination of technologies, such as virtualization, containers, and orchestration tools, to orchestrate workload migration, data synchronization, and communication between private and public cloud environments. This allows organizations to optimize resource utilization, improve performance, and enhance data security and compliance.

* **Community**

 Multi-cloud environments involve the use of multiple public cloud providers to host different workloads or applications.
 Organizations can leverage the strengths of multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, to access a diverse set of services, regions, and pricing options.
 Users have varying levels of control over each cloud provider's infrastructure, services, and management tools, depending on their specific requirements and preferences.
 Multi-cloud architectures allow organizations to avoid vendor lock-in, mitigate risks, and optimize performance and costs by distributing workloads across multiple cloud platforms. This requires careful planning, integration, and management of cloud resources, data, and applications to ensure interoperability, security, and compliance across environments.

In summary, the main differences between private, public, hybrid, and multi-cloud deployment models lie in ownership, accessibility, control, and the underlying architecture and technologies used to manage and orchestrate cloud resources. Each model offers unique benefits and trade-offs, and the choice depends on factors such as security, compliance, scalability, cost, and organizational requirements.

## Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS - What are differences?

![software_](https://qualitapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/303.png)

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
Definition: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It typically includes virtual machines, storage, and networking resources.
Features:
Allows users to rent virtualized hardware resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Users have control over the operating system, applications, and middleware, but are responsible for managing the infrastructure components, such as virtual machines and storage.
Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
Definition: PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
Features:
Offers a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, including tools, middleware, and runtime environments.
Users can focus on developing and deploying applications without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure.
Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
Definition: SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Users access these applications through a web browser.
Features:
Provides fully functional applications hosted in the cloud that users can access via the internet.
Users do not need to install, maintain, or update the software; the provider handles these tasks.
Examples: Salesforce, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox.

In simple terms, **IaaS** is like renting virtual computers, **PaaS** is like renting a platform for building apps, and **SaaS** is like using software over the internet without installing it.
## What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the cloud? 

![](https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/iStock-1724789360-1.jpg?quality=50&strip=all)

The cloud has a number of advantages and disadvantages :


* **Advantage - Scalabilty and Acessbilty**
Cloud services allow businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand. This flexibility enables organizations to handle fluctuating workloads without over-provisioning or underutilizing resources, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency.
* **Advantage – Cost Reduction**
The cloud provider takes on all of the hassles associated with infrastructure, maintenance and utility management for the servers.
Cloud-based applications are usually a fraction of the cost of locally installed software.
You also get the advantage of only paying for the server time or space that you use.

* **Advantage – Security**
The most obvious argument is that cloud providers will make a point to keep security protocols and software up to date because their business depends on it. Odds are good that most cloud providers have full-time staff members who specialize in digital/network security. How many small to medium-sized businesses can say the same?

* **Advantage – Reliability**
Cloud providers survive on redundancy. Your data isn’t just stored on a server. It’s stored across multiple servers.
Depending on the provider, it might even be stored on servers in multiple locations. Just in case there’s a catastrophic failure at a given server farm.
This means that no single hardware failure will hamstring your business. It also means that you can expect superb reliability in terms of accessing your data or services. Most providers even guarantee 99.99% uptime.

* **Advantage -Automatic Updates and Maintenance**
 Cloud services are regularly updated and maintained by the provider, ensuring that businesses have access to the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements without the need for manual intervention.<br>


* **Disadvantage – Security** 
Yes even though the security of the cloud can be an advantage it can also be the opposite.
Think of it this way. If your home has door locks, a security system, and security cameras, the infrastructure to stay safe is all there. Keeping your home safe requires actually locking your doors, arming the security system and keeping the cameras turned on.
The user is the weak link in almost all security systems. If you don’t use basic digital security methods, cloud computing is about as secure as leaving your laptop open at a coffee shop.

* **Disadvantage – Downtime**
As long as your Internet access is out, you can’t do anything with the cloud.

##  What is the difference between OpEx vs CapEx and how it relates the cloud?

![](https://images.ctfassets.net/xxmwcynv5jdx/41pD8xeHButkx3ryxmsmNO/d13e1ac45594e1b3fcc8d49aa8b26a20/capex-opex.jpg?w=1600&h=650&q=50&fit=fill&f=center)

**OpEx** (Operating Expenses) and **CapEx** (Capital Expenses) are two categories used in financial accounting to differentiate types of spending : 

* **OpEx** These are costs incurred in the normal course of business operations.
They are typically short-term expenses that are fully tax-deductible in the year they are incurred.
Examples include rent, utilities, salaries, maintenance, and subscription-based services.
* **CapEx** These are costs referring  to expenditures on physical assets that provide long-term value to a business.
These are typically large, one-time investments that benefit the company over multiple accounting periods.
Examples include purchasing equipment, building infrastructure, and software licenses.

How do they relate to the cloud? : 

* Cloud computing offers a shift from traditional CapEx to OpEx models for IT spending.
* Instead of making large upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, businesses can leverage cloud services and pay only for what they use on a subscription basis.
* This shift can provide several advantages, including cost savings, increased agility, and faster time-to-market for new projects.
* By moving IT expenses from CapEx to OpEx, businesses can better align costs with revenue and adapt more easily to changing business needs.

In summary, while CapEx involves upfront investments in long-term assets, OpEx refers to ongoing operational expenses. Cloud computing enables businesses to shift from CapEx to OpEx models by providing scalable, pay-as-you-go services, allowing for greater flexibility and cost efficiency.

## Is moving to the cloud always cheaper?

Migrating to the cloud is not always cheaper for every organization or every scenario. While cloud computing offers numerous benefits, including cost savings in many cases, there are situations where the cost of migration and ongoing cloud services may outweigh the potential savings. Here are some factors to consider:

* **Current Infrastructure** : If an organization has already heavily invested in on-premises infrastructure with long depreciation cycles remaining, the immediate cost savings from migrating to the cloud may be limited.
* **Workload Characteristics**: Certain workloads may be more cost-effective to run on-premises, especially those with predictable and steady resource usage. In contrast, highly variable workloads or those with bursty demand may benefit more from the scalability and pay-as-you-go nature of cloud services.
* **Data Transfer Costs**: Depending on the volume of data and network bandwidth requirements, transferring data to and from the cloud can incur significant costs, especially if there are frequent data transfers between on-premises systems and the cloud.
* **Licensing and Subscription Costs**: While cloud services often offer subscription-based pricing, the total cost can increase over time as usage grows or additional features are added. Organizations should carefully evaluate licensing models and subscription tiers to ensure they align with their needs and budget.
* **Storage and Compute Costs** : Cloud providers typically charge for storage and compute resources based on usage. Organizations should assess their resource requirements and optimize resource utilization to avoid unnecessary costs.
